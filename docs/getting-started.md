The easiest way to get started with a11ywatch is to use Docker [a11ywatch](https://github.com/A11yWatch/a11ywatch).

## Docker

`docker-compose -f development.yml up`

## Local

First run the bootstrap command `./bootstrap.sh` at the root of the project to setup the project dependacies. You can skip this step if running on docker. Then cd into each service and follow the instructions on the readme to start.
